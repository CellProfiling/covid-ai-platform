## Models

A list of models can be found [here](https://github.com/CellProfiling/covid-models/blob/master/src/manifest.bioimage.io.yaml).

## How to contribute?

COVID-19 model zoo is a static website, it reads a manifest file from Github repo [covid-model](https://github.com/CellProfiling/covid-models) (`manifest.bioimage.io.json`) and render the page in the browser. Therefore, contributing models to the repository is as easy as adding links of your models to the manifest file.

Please go to [covid-model](https://github.com/CellProfiling/covid-models) for more info on how to [contribute new models](https://github.com/CellProfiling/covid-models#how-to-contribute-new-models), [build BioEngine Apps](https://github.com/CellProfiling/covid-models#how-to-build-bioengine-apps) or [integrate the model zoo to your own software](https://github.com/CellProfiling/covid-models#how-integrate-the-model-zoo-to-my-own-software)
