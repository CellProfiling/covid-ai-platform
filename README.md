AI models, datasets and applications for COVID-19 related research


## Models

A list of models can be found [here](https://github.com/CellProfiling/covid19ai.io/blob/master/src/manifest.bioimage.io.yaml).

## How to contribute?

COVID-19 model zoo is a static website, it reads a manifest file from Github repo [covid-model](https://github.com/CellProfiling/covid19ai.io) (`manifest.bioimage.io.json`) and render the page in the browser. Therefore, contributing models to the repository is as easy as adding links of your models to the manifest file.

Please see [here](https://covid19ai.io/#/?show=contribute) for more information.
